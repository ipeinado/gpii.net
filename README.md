This is the git repository for the GPII.net sites. It currently includes all of the files for gpii.net, SAA and DeveloperSpace. 

Please note that the architecture for this site is likely to change significantly. 

1. Make /sites/gpii.net, /sites/developerspace.gpii.net, and /sites/saa.gpii.net into separate submodules
1. Adjust theme architecture so that SAA and DeveloperSpace are sub-themes of a common GPII.net base theme. 
1. Reorganize modules such that each site has it's own custom modules. Modules that are unique to a specific site should be stored in the modules folder for the site that they are used with.
